  The agent collector now adjusts default tolerations based on Kubernetes distributions.
  OpenShift infra nodes and AKS system nodes are included in default monitoring.
  Default tolerations are applied when `tolerations: []` is set, instead of being explicitly defined in `values.yaml`.
  To disable default tolerations (previously settable using the value `tolerations: []`), now only use the values `tolerations:` or `tolerations: null`.
