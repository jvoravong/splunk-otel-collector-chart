  - For users enabling both the operator and certmanager (.Values.operator.enabled=true, .Values.certmanager.enabled=true), please review the [upgrade guidelines](https://github.com/signalfx/splunk-otel-collector-chart/blob/main/UPGRADING.md#0119-to-0120).
  - Previously, certificates were generated by certmanager by default; now they are generated by Helm unless specified otherwise.
  - This change simplifies setup for new users while still supporting those who prefer certmanager.
