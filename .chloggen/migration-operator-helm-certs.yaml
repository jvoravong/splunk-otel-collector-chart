  - Previously, certificates were generated by cert-manager by default; now they are generated by Helm templates unless configured otherwise.
  - This change simplifies the setup for new users while still supporting those who prefer using cert-manager or other solutions. For more details, see the [related documentation](https://github.com/signalfx/splunk-otel-collector-chart/tree/main/docs/auto-instrumentation-install.md#tls-certificate-requirement-for-kubernetes-operator-webhooks).
  - If you use `.Values.operator.enabled=true` and `.Values.certmanager.enabled=true`, please review the [upgrade guidelines](https://github.com/signalfx/splunk-otel-collector-chart/blob/main/UPGRADING.md#0119-to-0120).
